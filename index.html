            <h2>Black Beauty</h2>
            <h3>"live your eyeliner,breathe your lipstick ,and kill for each other."</h3>
            <p> I made this poster keeping in mind the beauty you find, whether it is dark or light and white or black. You will find beauty everywhere.
                People fail to identify real beauty due to discrimination, but they don’t realize that once beauty lies inside once soul </p>

            <h3>"Lost time is never found again."</h3>
            <p> Time is one of the important things in one's life. Keeping this in mind I made a poster which 
                shows if you do not work on time, you will be in the midst of a forest and could not able to see the path of
                 success but if you give value to time then in that mist you are going to see the bright light which
                  shows you the path of success     </p>

            <h3>"Our heart is like the ocean, mysterious and dark."</h3>
            <p> I made this poster keeping in mind that The ocean is considered to be boundless, a place where one 
                can easily be lost, and can therefore be 
                seen to represent the boundless span of life, and the way one can get lost on the journey through life. </p>
